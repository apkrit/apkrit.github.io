<h1 class="centered-header">A Practice Designed for Tomorrow</h1>
<p>Anthonyâ€™s work is guided by a singular belief: law should keep pace with innovation, not lag behind it. Just as innovators push the limits of whatâ€™s possible, the law must evolve to protect those breakthroughs.
<br />
<br />His practice focuses on three pillars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intellectual Property â€“ Turning ideas into protected assets: patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing, and IP strategy.</li>
  <li>Startup Law â€“ Helping founders build strong foundations: incorporation, agreements, equity, and early-stage guidance.</li>
  <li>Business Law â€“ Drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts that stand the test of growth and change.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The name Singularity.lawyer reflects more than a brandâ€”itâ€™s a philosophy. Just as the singularity represents a point where technology and human potential converge, Anthonyâ€™s practice exists at the intersection of law and innovation.</p>

<p>He brings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technical fluency â†’ the ability to grasp complex software and hardware</li>
  <li>Strategic foresight â†’ anticipating risks before they become obstacles</li>
  <li>Creative problem-solving â†’ building legal solutions as adaptive as the technologies they protect</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 class="centered-header">A Partner for the Future</h1>
<p>Anthony doesnâ€™t see clients as cases to be filedâ€”he sees them as builders of the future. Legal counsel should not only protect what youâ€™ve built but also empower what comes next. Whether youâ€™re launching a startup, protecting an invention, or scaling your business, he is committed to guiding you through an accelerating world with clarity, confidence, and vision.</p>
